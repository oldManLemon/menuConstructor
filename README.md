# Simple Menu Generator
This is a simple python script to deal with mass menu creation for pages. 

**Background:** Boss wants a chnage in menus from the current tabs that are produced by fusion page builder on wordpress because you can't go retrace path neatly. So this menu is built with fusion builder in mind. The the werid stuff in slug.py is the shortcode fusion builder produces. 

**Solution:** Need to make multiple pages with the same micor menu on each. This is not going be easily acheiveable due to poor categorisation in the original wiki. However on the original page I can quickly check what menus I need, what i assume the links will be (force this issue with WP later). With that I can also copy the cat slug which generates the articles. So, plug them into details.txt or a csv and change accordingly. Then run script, whole thing produces the pages for copying and pasting back.

Can be modified to suite.
